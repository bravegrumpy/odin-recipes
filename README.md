# Odin Recipes

This is the first "project" in [The Odin Project Foundations course](https://theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).  So far, the the course has coverd basics, such as how to open a browser, how basic `WSL` [^1] works, and basic `git` commands.

I am *whizzing* through the course material, becasue I don't really want to spend a ton of time practicing git commands, when I've made thousands of commits. Take a look at [my github profile](https://github.com/bravegrumpy). While I don't have a ton of "public" projects, you should look at the [bravegrumpy project](https://github.com/bravegrumpy/bravegrumpy.website), where I store all of the sourcecode for [my personal website](https://www.bravegrumpy.com).  I am going through [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) as an excercise of finding the *right* information for my needs. I'm also going through it so I can colate the resources I actually deem useful.
