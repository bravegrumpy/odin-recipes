            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Passover, a springtime Jewish holiday, has a tradition of eating specific foods.  Each of the foods has specific religious significance and symbolism.  Every year, during the seder, directly translated as "orderd meal", the story of how the jews escaped slavery in Egypt is told.  In short its the same story as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Prince of Egypt</a>. The chorset symbolizes the mortar the slaves used inbetween the bricks because of its texture, and the sweetness of freedom because it is sweet. </p>
            <p>There are as many charoset recipes as there are Jews. The basic requirements are to have wine, nuts and apple. This recipe, with much more than that, is the recipe my mother used. During passover, I would eat this stuff on matzah like jam on toast.</p>
            <p>Yeild: 6 cups</p>
